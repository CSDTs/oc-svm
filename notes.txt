for layers, note MobileNet and ShuffleNet

for a good way to use CNNs on images as features and then pass
to the OC-SVM for training, prediction

The issue is that we don't really understand the feature space, depending on
the CNN, we have these texture basises, not sure how to manipulate or explain that

Could have to students learn the basis? Would be easier if it was better grounded
